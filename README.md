# ArrowGame
A two-player competitive game I made as a side project to get more familiar with Unity.

For this side project I wanted to make a small 1v1 with a focus on managing ammo and positioning. Since both players fire arrows that stick in place afte rbeing fired, they have to commit to a shot and risk runnign out of ammo or try and bait the other player into shooting first. It leads to tense engagements to start with that leads to a mad dash for spare arrows or a frantic chase once someone fires the first shot. 

Most of the project was just trying to build experience with unity and expermient with some systems I hadn't interacted with much before.
